# Documentation maintenance

Status: repository maintenance baseline, 2026-08-10.

## Directory ownership

- `docs/` is exclusively the MkDocs public user-manual source. Its direct children are locale directories.
- `development/` contains internal engineering contracts, maintenance policy, and historical
  baselines under `development/baselines/`. It is not published by MkDocs.
- `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `PRIVACY.md` remain root repository documents.

Do not reintroduce non-locale folders under `docs/`.

## Maintained languages and fallback

English (`docs/en`) and Simplified Chinese (`docs/zh`) are complete maintained baselines. Other configured locales may contain a maintained page when a reviewer can validate it; otherwise `mkdocs-static-i18n` must serve the current English page through `fallback_to_default: true`.

A stale translation is worse than a labeled fallback. When product behavior changes, update every maintained translation of that page in the same change or remove the obsolete override so fallback becomes authoritative.

The MkDocs language set must match the app's explicit interface languages: en, ar, de, es, fr, ja, ko, pt-BR, ru, vi, zh, and zh-Hant.

## Page-to-source map

| Manual page | Primary source of truth |
| --- | --- |
| `getting-started.md`, `about.md`, `language.md`, `appearance.md` | build configuration, About/Language/Appearance settings pages, localized resources |
| `provider.md`, `models.md`, `local-model.md` | provider registry/settings, model repository/settings, local model manager |
| `generation.md`, `context.md`, `title-generation.md` | generation/context/title settings, request builders, conversation runtime |
| `transcription.md`, `image-generation.md`, `pdf-import.md` | respective settings pages, attachment/render pipeline, request builder |
| `system-prompts.md` | prompt settings/editor, default prompt source, variable resolver |
| `tools.md`, `web-search.md`, `mcp.md`, `automation.md` | tool registry/settings, MCP repository and popular-server catalog, Task/Loop scheduling, Heartbeat scheduler/prompt builder, SMS poller, notification listener |
| `assistant.md`, `live-voice.md` | assistant entry points and overlay state (`assistant/`), Live voice transport (`assistant/live/`), `SettingsAssistantPage`, `SettingsLiveVoicePage` |
| `shell.md`, `sandbox.md`, `proxy.md` | shell device settings/clients, flavor sandbox manager, shared HTTP client |
| `search.md`, `embedding.md`, `memory.md` | conversation-search settings, embedding repository, memory tools/storage |
| `conversations.md` | chat controller/runtime, Room graph DAO, composer and drawer UI |
| `import-export.md` | `development/import-export.md`, archive manifest/version, exporters/importers, auto-backup worker |
| `privacy.md`, `faq.md`, `index.md` | cross-page synthesis verified against all sources above |

Exact class names may move. Search the current settings route and user-visible string first, then follow the active implementation rather than copying a historical filename.

## Change checklist

For any behavior, default, setting, network destination, persistence, security, or supported-language change:

1. identify every affected English and Simplified Chinese page;
2. update maintained translated overrides or remove them to activate fallback;
3. update MkDocs nav and every DocumentationFab target if paths change;
4. update README/architecture/privacy when the claim is repository-level;
5. check root documents and `development/` for old paths and superseded state-machine claims;
6. build docs normally and with strict warnings;
7. run an internal-link/target scan for every generated locale;
8. review the generated site route used by the app's DocumentationFab;
9. record source evidence and residual translation gaps in the task log.

## Required gates

A documentation change is not complete until:

- `git diff --check` passes;
- no conflict marker or legacy public-tree development-document path remains;
- every MkDocs nav target exists in English;
- every configured locale builds, including fallback-only locales;
- strict MkDocs emits no warning;
- documentation links resolve in the generated site;
- code-backed claims have been spot-checked against current source;
- the GitHub Pages workflow succeeds after the authorized push.
